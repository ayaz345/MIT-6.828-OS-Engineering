# Homework 2 - Shell

## 0. Software setup

The course provides a shell script [t.sh](./t.sh) with an incomplete xv6 shell source code [sh.c](./sh.c) at the beginning. Build the shell executable and run the script, the execution will output error messages because some features haven't been implemented in the shell source code.

```sh
$ gcc sh.c
$ ./a.out < t.sh
redir not implemented
exec not implemented
pipe not implemented
exec not implemented
exec not implemented

```

Read Chapter 0 of the [xv6 book](../../resources/xv6-book-rev11.pdf).
